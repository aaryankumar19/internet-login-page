🔐 24Online Auto Login Extension
This is a small Chrome extension made for LPU's 24Online login portal. It auto-fills your ID and password and logs you in with a double-click. It also lets you save or reset your credentials anytime.

Yeah, it includes some satire (you’ll see 😅), but it’s harmless and just for fun.

💡 Features
Auto login on 24online/webpages/client.jsp

Save your ID and password
Reset credentials anytime

Optional theme injection (toggle in popup)

🛠️ How to Install
Download or clone this repo:

```
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/24online-auto-login.git
Go to chrome://extensions/ in your browser
```

Enable Developer mode (top-right toggle)

Click "Load unpacked" and select this folder

That’s it! On first install, a popup will ask you to enter your ID and password.

⚠️ Note
This is a personal project made for LPU students using the 24Online system. Not affiliated with or endorsed by anyone. Just trying to save a few clicks 🙃
